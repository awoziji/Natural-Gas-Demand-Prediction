# Natural-Gas-Demand-Prediction
# Motivation
Natural gas account for 1/4 of the global demand and roughly 1/3 of the US energy demand. After oil, Natural gas is the most dominad sort of energy. So, being about to improve natural gas demand prediction is extremely valuable. This will allow midstream companies to optimize their storage capacity, strategically plan for future demand, and lower the risk of energy shortage.

Therefore, this project aims to predict the demand of Natural Gas in the US by combining a wide range of datasets including the Hery Hub Natural Gas spot price, US weather averages (daily), US Natural Gas storage (weekly) and production (monthly), US population (Annually), and Import & Exports (Monthly) for the last 10 years.

# Data Sources
- For the Hery Hub Natural Gas spot price, Import & Exports (Monthly), and storage data (weekly), I used csv data from the US Energy Information Administration website. https://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/
- For the US weather averages (daily), I used the Climate Engine database. https://app.climateengine.org/
- For the US population (annually), I used the bureau of the census database. https://www.census.gov/
